***Task Management App***

This app helps users manage tasks effectively, categorized into Open, In Progress, and Closed statuses. It features an intuitive table-based interface with search, sorting, and keyboard navigation. Users can view and edit task details in a focus mode (modal), including changing task statuses and adding comments.

***Key Features -***

***1. Task Views (Tabs)***

Three tabs: Open, In Progress, and Closed.
Default tab: Open.
Displays the task count for each status.
Tabs and their settings persist across page reloads.

***2. Task Table***
Columns: Priority, ID, Status, Labels, Name, Due Date, Created At, Assignee.
Infinite scroll pagination: Loads more tasks as you scroll.
Keyboard navigation:
Up/Down Arrow Keys: Navigate tasks.
Enter Key: Open a task in focus mode.

***3. Sorting & Search***
Sorting: By "Created At" (persistent after reload).
Search: By task name (persistent after reload).
Options to clear sorting and search.

***4. Focus Mode (Modal)***

Task Details: View task info and comments.
Actions:
Change task status (Open, In Progress, or Closed).
Leave/update comments for status changes.
Keyboard Shortcuts:
Left/Right Arrow Keys: Navigate tasks in modal.
Number Keys (1/2/3): Change status to Open, In Progress, or Closed.

***5. Task Status Management***
When a task's status changes:
It moves to the appropriate tab.
The task remains visible in focus mode during navigation.


***System Design Basics -***

**1. Architecture Overview**
The app follows a client-server architecture.

***Frontend:***
Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Context API manages global state (tasks, search, and sorting).
Uses localStorage for persisting user preferences like selected tabs, search terms, and sorting options.

***Backend (Optional):***
A Node.js/Express backend can be integrated for persistent storage.
Stores task data, comments, and user actions in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
Backend APIs handle operations like fetching tasks, updating statuses, and storing comments.
Database Schema (Example):

***Tasks Table:***

id (Primary Key)
name (Task Name)
status (Open/In Progress/Closed)
priority (High/Medium/Low)
labels (Array of tags)
due_date (Deadline)
created_at (Timestamp)
assignee (Assigned user)

***Comments Table:***

id (Primary Key)
task_id (Foreign Key to Tasks Table)
comment (Text)
created_at (Timestamp)

***2. Data Flow***
Frontend:

Fetches tasks from the backend via REST APIs or GraphQL.
Updates task statuses and comments in real time, sending changes to the backend.

***Backend:***

Serves task data to the frontend.
Handles updates to task statuses and stores comments.

***3. Key Components***


***Client-Side Logic:***
React components for displaying tasks in tabs, a table, and modals.
Local state for managing UI interactions.

***Backend Services (Optional):***

***Task Service:*** Fetches, updates, and filters tasks.

***Comment Service:*** Manages comments for tasks.

***Database:***
Tasks and comments are stored with relationships to ensure data integrity.

***4. Scalability Considerations***

***Frontend:*** 
Use efficient state management libraries like Redux for large-scale apps.

***Backend:*** Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like tasks.

***Database:*** Index columns used in sorting and searching (e.g., created_at, name).

***Technologies Used -***

***React:*** For building the interface.

***Ant Design:*** For UI components like tables and modals.

***Mocked Data:*** Simulates task data.

***Installation -***

Clone and run the app locally:


```
git clone https://github.com/akashdubey2211/frontend-assignment
cd frontend-assignment
npm install
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.
```

***Summary -***

View tasks by status (Open, In Progress, Closed).
Sort and search tasks with settings that persist after reloads.
Edit tasks in focus mode (modal) with status updates and comments.
System Design: The app can optionally integrate a backend for persistent data storage and scalability.
